        <p>My name is Imogen McGough (<em>im-uh-jin mig-yo</em>). I'm a queer transfemme and software
          engineer.</p>
        <p>In a professional context I'm passionate about creating <strong>great user experiences</strong>, whether I'm
          designing an API, a CLI tool or a React SPA. Engineers should work hard so that their users don't need to.
        </p>
        <p>I enjoy <strong>solving ambiguous problems</strong>. I'm comfortable working through a Kanban board
          with a team but I've done my best work when given the freedom to pursue key business goals without a roadmap.
        </p>
        <p>I <strong>love to teach</strong> others and enthusiastically share what excites me: a new framework, language
          or design pattern.</p>
        <p>Outside of work I love rock climbing, organic chemistry, making music and learning languages. I play card
          games
          semi-competitively and have placed several times within the top 500 players in North America (Hearthstone,
          Magic: The Gathering). My favorite chess opening is the <a target="_blank"
