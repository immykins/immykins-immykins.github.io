        <p>My name is Imogen. I'm a queer transwoman and software engineer.</p>
        <p>In a professional setting I love to think about <strong>user experience</strong>, solving <strong>real
            business
            problems</strong>
          and
          <strong>improving process</strong>.

        <p>Whether it's an API, CLI tool or a JavaScript SPA, I put effort into building something that's a joy to
          use. It's worth spending extra time to make something intuitive. Playfulness can be a good!</p>
        <p>Many of the software engineers I've worked with show deep creativity and talent when given the
          opportunity to express themselves. I believe in teamwork and communication first and foremost but have done
          my best work when given the freedom to solve key business problems without a roadmap or Kanban

          work - how can we enable them? When a production outage occurs, how can we prevent that problem
          from resurfacing?</p>
        <p>Outside of work I love rock climbing, organic chemistry, making music and learning languages. I play card
          games
          semi-competitively and have placed several times within the top 500 players in North America (Hearthstone,
          Magic: The Gathering). My favorite chess opening is the <a target="_blank"
