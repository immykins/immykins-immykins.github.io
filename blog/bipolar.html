      <p>
        I'm a neuroscience student at university. Or maybe I'm a bit older, a software engineer at a startup. I'm
        brilliant. I'm coding for hours, up until 4am then functioning perfectly four or five hours later. The
        creativity
        is pouring out of my brain. I'm taking on loads of extra work, overloading classes, working in three different
        research labs. I spend all weekend staining rat brain with BrdU. Studying for my GRE and my MCAT. When I get
        home
        I code markov chain generators, sudoku solvers. I'm leading a team, I'm driving multiple big projects forward.
        I'm
        redesigning our interview flow, onboarding multiple people, integrating work with other teams. Pushing
        for big things we've been overlooking at the company. My boss publicly
        calls me his "rockstar manager". I'm a perfect machine and anything is possible. I'm taking 23 credits of
        classes
        and have a 3.9 GPA. I pick up a dual major in Biochemistry.</p>

      <p>I drop a grand on beauty treatments and clothes in one week. I bleach my hair blond, get lash extensions,
        botox.
        It's fine - I deserve it, I'm kicking ass. I'm an engine, a robot. I count calories, control my eating, rock
        climb
        four days a week. I'm stronger than I've ever been, learning to lead belay. I don't eat breakfast, then I cut
        out
        lunch. Eating food is time I could spend getting shit done. I'm down to 120 pounds. I can see a six pack now. I
        have perfect control over every aspect of my life. I
        love my body, I'm beautiful, charming and feel unusually extroverted. People enjoy my presence and I'm so much
        fun. I hook up with a new person every night - the attention is intoxicating.</p>

      <p>The cracks start to show. I can barely keep the anger from leaking out. I'm still barely sleeping, but I'm
        so
        irritable that I've stopped hanging out with people and instead isolate in my room, hoping this will pass and
        I'll
        stop lashing out. I snap at my roommate over something trivial. I'm becoming a little paranoid - worried someone
        is trying to steal from me, take advantage of me.</p>

      <p>Not now, please not now. I'm clamping down as much as I can on the pipe, but the water keeps finding new
        places to
        leak from. The candle has been burning at both ends for far too long. I'm the janitor in <em>Flowers for
          Algernon</em>,
        only able to watch as my powers fade away.</p>

      <p>I'm <strong>so fucking stupid</strong>. I can't focus on anything. My anxiety is out of control. Between
        meetings I just sit
        there
        in a stupor. I dissociate for days at a time, barely committing code. I'm in a theater, watching my body move on
        a
        film screen. I keep meeting with the PI of my lab for thesis revisions - I think she practically writes half of
        my
        honors thesis, the words won't come out and I can't focus enough to read more research papers. I worked
        <strong>SO
          FUCKING
          HARD</strong> for this, I won't let it slip away, I don't care what I have to do. I work twice as hard and
        can't even get
        half as much done.
      </p>

      <p>I'm so ugly I can't look at a mirror without immediate revulsion. I hate myself. Everything is hopeless. I
        tell a
        close friend that I think I'm going to kill myself - that no one would miss me. My brain is broken but I can't
        figure out why. I'm so tired of throwing darts at the SSRI list and only feeling worse for them. I spend
        countless
        hours reading the DSM, research papers on anxiolytics, psychedelics, anti-depressants, herbal tinctures. I can
        babble at length about atypical depression, MAOI efficacy, partial agonists. I see therapists. Nothing works.
        There's a lingering thought, something I learned about in my coursework on neurodegenerative diseases and mental
        illness - but I'm not sure it fits and it's not something I want to consider - a death sentence, scary
        medications, tardive dyskinesia, kidney damage, social stigma.</p>

      <p>I'm completely burnt out. I disappear, move to another part of the country, let a lot of people down.</p>

      <p>But this time - I get a diagnosis. I start a new medication. I feel a lot more stable. I don't trust this at
        all,
        I'm just waiting for it to get bad again. But it feels like I might be getting somewhere.</p>
