      <p><small><em>This is the first article in a series where I vent my strong opinions on running engineering
            interviews. Here, I'll talk about common mistakes. In parts 2 and 3 I'll compare different interview formats

      <p>There's this endless lamentation from engineers of how painful it is to interview for a new job. You set aside
        multiple days for the process, solve silly whiteboarding problems and are met with a frustratingly generic
        rejection letter if
        you don't get an offer.</p>
      <p>For early-stage startups in particular, very little thought is put into designing an interview process. The
        payoff for putting in time isn't immediately obvious and you have so many other things to get done. So you <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming">cargo cult</a> interviews you've endured in the
        past. It's almost like hazing — you suffered through it, so any worthy software engineer should be
        able to as well.</p>
      <p>I, like many others, hate this process and as a new manager saw this as my new crusade to wage. But I quickly
        realized that <strong>interviewing sucks for everyone</strong> and that there's no quick and easy fix to it.
        That doesn't mean that you should give up. With careful consideration (as well as <em>iteration</em>) you
        can both mitigate pain for everyone involved and adequately vet candidates.</p>
      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p></p>
      <h2>What You Should Optimize For</h2>
      <p>1. <strong>Think critically</strong> about the qualities you want to surface in a candidate.</p>
      <p>2. Minimize interviewing days. /strong> to interview length.</p>
      <p>3. Be flexible with each candidate.</p>

Notes:

Part 1 -
Common interviewing mistakes
Too long / too many stages
Too short
You don't know what you're looking for ("I'll know it when I see it") / test for the wrong things
You focus too much on coding
Inflexible / don't let them show you their strengths (ask them!)
You confuse confidence with competence - bias
You don't validate your interview process.
You don't prepare candidates beforehand
People fall through the cracks
You don't train interviewers - consider collecting feedback?

Part 2 -
Different interview formats
("the module")
(pairing)
(code review)
(technical discussion "drill down")
(leetcode) - feels unnatural, puts people on the spot

Part 3 - Example interview flows
Phone call - what to ask candidate, establishing a timeline, highlighting their strengths
First technical interview
The "on-site"
Rejecting candidates
Making an offer

What are the goals

Different interviews for different candidates, even by experience. You need to

Interviewing should be as pleasant as possible. Treat

Don't let people fall through the cracks. <a
