      <p>Integration testing your cloud infrastucture with Pulumi and Jest</p>
      <p>Pulumi is typescript IaaC. They have a <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/docs/guides/testing/integration/">cool
          thing</a> written in Go, but I really just wanted to use Jest for all of my application testing so I could
        keep everything in a single repo with a single test runner.</p>
      <p>The downside is that it's slow - spinning up and tearing down infrastructure, in the simplest of cases, will
        take over a minute. Tag these tests and only run them before a deployment - they can easily be baked into a
        CI/CD
        system and gate automated deployments.</p>
      <p>Go is very much the <em>lingua franca</em> of cloud infrastructure so I may end up splitting my pulumi code out
        and migrating to their integration test framework.</p>
